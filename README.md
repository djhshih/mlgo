# Machine learning algorithms in Go

## Introduction

This project aims to provide minimalistic machine learning algorithms in Go. We will aspire to efficient implementation of these algorithms, and we will take advantage of Go's concurrency paradigm wherever possible.

## Status

### Clustering

#### Implemented

- Gaussian mixture model
- k-means, k-medians, k-medoids
- single-linkage hierarchical clustering

#### In-progress

- generic hierarchical clustering
- spectral clustering
- Hierarchical Ordered Partitioning and Collapsing Hybrid (HOPACH)

#### Planned

- self-organizing maps

### Classification

#### Planned

- k-means based classifier
- feed-forward neural network
- support-vector machine
- naive Bayes

### Modeling

#### Planned

- hidden Markov model
